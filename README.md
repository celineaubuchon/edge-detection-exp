# edge-detection-exp
# README
To run the code in experiment.m, you must have Psychtoolbox-3 installed.

Quick how-to-run:

1)Go to edge_detection_new script

2)Click "Run"

3)Watch how computer edge detection weakens as photo noise increases

4)Go to experiment script

5)Click "Run"

6)Enter your initials

7)Image will appear with 2 red horizontal lines and a small vertical line between them. Use right and left arrows to navigate alone red road and press enter at every edge between section you discern.

8)Once done with picture, press space bar to continue to next picture

9)Do this for 9 total photos

10)Go to analysis script

11)Follow first comment: Change he file path o data/your data.txt....

12)Click "Run"

13)See new graph with your data included and observe difference between human and computer edge detection



The scripts:

edgedetection: Implement Sobel edge detection on 3 images of varying degrees of complexity (silhouette of MATLAB logo, clipart sloth face, and Professor Serre's profile picture) with 3 different amounts of Gaussian blur (0, 0.02, and 0.04).
      Main script: for loop that reads images, runs functions to calculate values for calculating edge magnitude, and runs this fuction again after rotating the image 90 degress (rotation allows us to calculate both horizontal and vertical edges)
      For loop gif?: Generates collection of photos with large range of gaussian blur intensities and runs them through the edge detection calculations, saving the edge detection copies as well (in the 'blurred' folder). This is used by a function in the analysis script to generate an evolving visualization of computer edge detection accuracy as photo noise increases. (tldr: The gif).
      Convolve1D: Uses two kernels to calculate value for magnitude

experiment: user interface and data collection code

analysis: Takes in files generated by the human data and sobel operator and converts the black and white convolved image into a color image and generates an overlay image of the edge detected areas in red.
      Function: Creates 1x3 figure with original image increasing noise, computer detection of that, and an overlay. (tldr: Gif Generation)
